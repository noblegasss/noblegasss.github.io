## Hello 👋🏻 Welcome!

Hi, I'm Wei. You can call me Wei or Nova, whatever you like! Nice to meet you!  

I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics @ University of Miami. My main research interests include biomarker detection, subtype clustering, and association analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, with application to cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. My thesis topic focuses on multivariate random forest for dimension reduction and subtype clustering in the integrative analysis of multi-omics data. This blog is just for sharing some of my study notes and thoughts. Feel free to discuss with me if you read something that interests you in my blog:)
